  example for constructing data to send to backend:
        data = {
            user: {   }, // current user object; used to check permissions
            query: {   } // whatever data you want to send
        }

        const { result } = await axios.post(url, data);


- orders are identified with custID and restID so no need to store those as lists
    in cust and rest. This is becuase both lists may potentially get too big
    - use .populate when making queries https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html
