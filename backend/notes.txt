- need to generate unique ID's for restaurant and customer - not using DB given IDs
    for ease of use in customer/restaurant referencing.
    - use db generated id for items as item number will not be referenced as often IRL
        restaurants would likely use the item name
- orders are identified with custID and restID so no need to store those as lists
    in cust and rest. This is becuase both lists may potentially get too big
    - use .populate when making queries https://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html
- pickup date/time formatting?
